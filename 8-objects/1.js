// What are objects [in JavaScript] used for? Why might you use an object?

// objects in Javascript are data with variables and methods.
// the data structure is similar to a Hash in Ruby --> var person = { firstname: "Jen", lastname: "Homann", age: 30}
// you would use a JS object when you want to tie multiple pieces of information to one piece of data, in a manner in which you can later call that information
